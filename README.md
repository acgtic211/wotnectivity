# Wotnectivity
JAVA library to connect to different communication protocols of IoT devices.

## Common Communication Protocols

### Zigbee - Zwave
Depends on the gateway used to control the devices. Until now we are studying 2 models of gateways (Hopefully avaliable in Europe).

* Wink Hub 2 - ![https://winkapiv2.docs.apiary.io/#reference/device/desired-state-and-last-reading] <--- Looks good.
* Samsung Smarthings API - ![https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/api-ref/st-api.html#section/Overview]

### KNX

We have disponibility of the KNX InSide MTN6500 gateway so our studies will be based on this gateway of KNX.

To use these kinds of devices we have to know the {ip}:{port}/{groupAddress} an the data type acepted by that group.
